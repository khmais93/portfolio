            <h3>Food Order App</h3>
          </header>

          <p>
            Food order app is an I build based on the Udemy project build by
            Maximilian Schwarzmüller. In this project, I used Redux, Axios and
            Lodash. Data was consumed from an api I build using Firbase. Most of
            the styling is provided by Max. Schwarzmüller. All the JS was
            written by me.

            <br /><br /><strong>Technologies used: </strong> React, Redux,
            Router, Lodash, Firebase, axios.

          </header>

          <p>
            This app is the final project for the Udacity React-Redux course,
            which is part of the React Nanodegree program.

            <br /><br />It's a web application that allows users to play the
            game "Would You Rather?" The game is played like this: a user is
            asked, "Would you like [option A] or [option B]?" It is against the
            rules to answer "neither" or "both."

            <br /><br />Users, which are some Pokemons, can ask and answer
            questions, check which questions they have or have not answered, see
            how other Pokemons voted, and see how they rank on the leaderboard
            with this app.

            <br /><br />On the home page, after logging in, the Pokemon can
            toggle between his/her answered and unanswered polls. In all
            categories, the polls are organized from most recently created to
            least recently created.

            <br /><br />When a Pokemon votes in a poll, all of the information
            from the poll that was answered is presented. On the poll details
            page, the Pokemon's response is recorded and clearly apparent.
            Pokemons are only allowed to vote once per question and cannot
            change their answers once they have voted. The polling question
            appears in the "Answered" column when the user returns to the main
            page.

            <br /><br /><strong>Technologies used: </strong> React, Redux,
            Router, Semantic UI.

          <p>
            MyReads is a virtual bookcase to store your books and track what
            you’re reading. Using the provided Books API, you’ll search for
            books and add them to a bookshelf you choose. It is possible also to
            move books from one shelf to another. This app is one of the two
            projects required for Udacity's React Nanodegree program.
            <br /><br /><strong>Technologies used: </strong> React, Router.

          <h2>About Me</h2>
          <p>
            I'm Khmais (pronounced as James, but in Spanish), Tunisian based in
            Halle (Saale), Germany. A self-taught front-end developer switching
            careers from Electrical Engineering to Web Development. I have two
            university degrees, first one was in Electrical Engineering which I
            got from a Tunisian university and the second one was a master
            degree in Photovoltaics from HS Anhalt - Deutschland. I learned web
            development through online lectures, mainly from Udemy and Udacity
            websites, most of the help I get, as every developer, is from Google
            or Stackoverflow, but my fav is always the webdev subreddit in
            Reddit. Currently, I'm enrolled in a workshop where self taught
            React developers gather online and practice what they learned, this
            workshop is coordinated by
            <a target="_blank" href="https://www.redi-school.org/"
